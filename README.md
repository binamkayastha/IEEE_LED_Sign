# IEEE_LED_Sign [Abandoned]

Python code which takes a picture input, and outputs an arduino code which will display the picture for the custom LED Sign, which is currently located in the IEEE Student Branch Lounge at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

Currently the python code takes the image png from the repo and displays it on the LED Sign. Every few seconds, it will increment the picture one to the right, then one to the left.

Later, the code will feature the image going from right to left, so that large texts of information is able to be displayed.

## Why was it abandoned?
This code was for a very specific setup for the LED's, which I no longer own. Also I'm not particularly proud of this spaghetti code.
